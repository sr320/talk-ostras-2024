The listed publications collectively contribute to the genomic characterization and conservation of _Ostrea lurida_, the Olympia oyster, through various research focuses and methodologies:  
  
1. **Timmins-Schiffman et al. (2013)**: This paper lays the groundwork for genomic resource development in shellfish, including Ostrea lurida. It emphasizes the importance of genomic tools in conservation efforts, offering a foundational approach for subsequent research in the species' genetic characterization.  
  
2. **White et al. (2017)**: Focusing on genotype-by-sequencing, this study investigates genetic variations in three different populations of Olympia oysters. It contributes to understanding population-specific genetic structures, which is crucial for conservation strategies tailored to different geographic regions.  
  
3. **Hintz et al. (2017)**: This research presents a nonlethal method for studying Olympia oysters, enabling ongoing research without harming the organisms. Such methods are vital for conservation as they allow for repeated observations and analyses over time.  
  
4. **Heare et al. (2017)**: This paper provides evidence of population structure in Puget Sound's Ostrea lurida. Understanding population structure is key to conservation as it helps in identifying genetically distinct groups that may require different management approaches.  
  
5. **Heare et al. (2018)**: This study examines the differential response to stress in Ostrea lurida using gene expression. Insights into stress responses are important for conservation, especially in the face of environmental changes and stressors.  
  
6. **Silliman et al. (2018)**: This research highlights consistent differences in fitness traits across Olympia oyster generations. Fitness traits are essential for understanding the adaptive potential of species, which informs conservation and restoration efforts.  
  
7. **Silliman (2019)**: This study on population structure, genetic connectivity, and adaptation provides comprehensive insights into the genetic makeup and adaptive responses of Olympia oysters along the west coast of North America. This contributes significantly to conservation genetics.  
  
8. **Spencer et al. (2020)**: Investigating the carryover effects of temperature and pCO2, this study provides important information on how climate change factors affect Olympia oysters. This is crucial for predicting and mitigating future impacts on oyster populations.  
  
9. **Becker et al. (2020)**: Focusing on the spatial and temporal distribution of early life stages, this research informs about critical developmental phases of the Olympia oyster, aiding in the understanding of population dynamics and effective conservation strategies.  
  
10. **Spencer et al. (2021)**: Examining the latent effects of winter warming on reproduction and larval viability, this study adds to the understanding of how climate change could impact the reproductive success and long-term viability of Olympia oysters.  
  
11. **Spencer, Roberts, Silliman (2023)**: This paper explores the population-specific effects of ocean acidification, adding to the body of knowledge about how different environmental stressors impact Ostrea lurida, which is critical for predicting and mitigating the impacts of ocean acidification.  
  
12. **Silliman et al. (2023)**: This study investigates the coupled epigenetic and genetic population structure, providing a nuanced understanding of how genetic and epigenetic factors contribute to the population dynamics of marine invertebrates, including Ostrea lurida.  
  
In summary, these publications cover a range of topics from genetic diversity, population structure, stress responses, effects of environmental changes, nonlethal research methods, and early life stage dynamics, all of which are essential for the effective conservation and management of the Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida.
